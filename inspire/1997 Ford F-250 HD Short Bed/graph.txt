Seller's Description
1997 F250 crew cab XLT. 241,141 miles. I owned the truck for over 20 years .Had the truck painted about 12 years ago. At that time I had new fenders and a fiberglass hood installed. The bed is starting to bubble above the rear tires and behind  the tires on the bottom of the bed. (above the tailpipe). The truck is NOT perfect its NOT a show truck. It’s going on 25 years old. Mechanically the truck runs good. ￼ The motor is all stock.
I did install aftermarket gauges. Transmission temperature ,exhaust temperature and boost. It also has exhaust brake,six gun bully dog tuner and 3” down pipe exhaust. K&N air filter. It has rear air bags with an onboard air compressor. 
  Built for camping ,  long weekends and traveling. The camper shell has 200 watts of solar charge controller 2000 watt inverter. 2 6volt batteries in series  11.5 gallons solar shower. Way too much to list. I really don’t need to sell so please don’t waste my time or your time. Clean title.$18,000 Thanks
